<details class = "details"><summary class = "summary"> <b>How are PFAS regulated in drinking water? What is a "Maximum Contaminant Level (MCL)" ?</b> </summary>

<p>There is currently no federal drinking water standard in place for PFAS. However, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has a non-inforceable health advisory of 70 ng/L for the sum of two PFAS chemicals, PFOA and PFOS. </p>
<p>In October 2020, the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) finalized a Maximum Contaminant Level (MCL) of 20 ng/L for the sum of six PFAS compounds (PFOS, PFOA, PFHxS, PFNA, PFHpA, and PFDA).</p>

<b>What does "ug/L" and "mg/L" mean?</b> 

<p>Concentrations in drinking water are typically shown as "ug/L", micrograms per liter, or "mg/L", milligrams per liter. Micrograms per liter is also sometimes written as parts per billion (ppb) and milligrams per liter can be written as parts per million (ppm). Micrograms per liter is 1000 time smaller than milligrams per liter</p>

<br>

 <b>My town exceeded a federal guideline. What does that mean? </b> 
 
<p>Public water systems in Massachusetts that exceed federal standards are typically required to take corrective action. Your public water system is required to notify customers of the exceedances and in some cases share public education materials. Contact your local water department to find out more.</p>


<br>

<b>What does "Not Detected" mean?</b> 

<p> A testing result may be "Not Detected" if the chemical is not present at all or if it is present at a low level that the laboratory cannot reliably measure.</p>

<br>

<b>Why is my town not available in the report tool? </b> 
<p>This report was generated using publically available drinking water testing data from the state of Massachusetts. Towns report the results of their water testing to the state and they are uploaded into a database that is maintained by the State. Your town may not be included if they did not conduct testing or they did not report testing to the State. </p>

<p> The data for this tool was downloaded in early April 2022, so it may not reflect most recent testing results.</p>



<br>

<b>I have a private well. Should I be concerned? </b> 

<p> Private well owners are not required to test their well water, but the state does have resources for private well owners looking to test their water. For more information, including a testing program currently offered by DEP, visit the state's <a href= "https://www.mass.gov/private-wells"> Private Wells page</a>.</p>

<b>Did my drinking water cause my cancer?</b> 

<p>It can be difficult or impossible to link an illness such as cancer to a specific chemical exposure. The contaminants included in this tool have been identified by EPA to increase the risk of cancer for long-term exposure above the Maximum Contaminant Level (MCL). </p>

<b>How can my family reduce our risk of exposure to carcinogens in drinking water?</b>
<p>There are several steps you can take to reduce exposures in your home and community: </p>

<li>At-home water filters can remove some contaminants from drinking water. However, no single treatment system is effective at removing all contaminants. Before purchasing a filter, determine which contaminants you want to reduce in your drinking water. The University of Massachusetts Amherst Extension program has a helpful <ahref = "https://ag.umass.edu/sites/ag.umass.edu/files/fact-sheets/pdf/treatmentquestions.pdf">resource </a> summarizing water treatment technologies and the contaminants they can remove. Make sure to follow the manufacturer's instructions and replace the filters as recommended. </li>
<li>Join or support a local community group that is working on water quality issues. You can find ones in your community using this <a href="https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/7d098a603c664a9e91f4f88c1c89e5d1/page/Page-1/?views=Community-Resources">Connecting Communities tool</a></li>
<li>Register to <a href = "https://vote.gov/">vote</a> if you're eligible and participate in local decision-making.</li>
<li> Call on companies to eliminate harmful chemicals from their products. Join <a href = "https://saferchemicals.org/get-involved/">campaigns</a> to get toxic chemicals out of consumer products.</li>

<br> 

<b>What about other contaminants? How do I find out more about water testing in my town?</b> 

<p>This tool only contains a subset of chemicals that have standards that consider cancer risk. Public water systems are required to provide residents with a Consumer Confidence Report annually. This report details the results of all water testing done by a public water system in that year. Call or go online to your local water department to find out more. </p>
